## Getting started (SR)

In this tutorial, we show how to use `physo` to perform Symbolic Regression (SR).
The reference notebook for this tutorial can be found here: [ðŸ“™sr_quick_start.ipynb](https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO/blob/main/demos/sr_quick_start.ipynb).

### Setup

Importing the necessary libraries:
```
# External packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
```

Importing `physo`:
```
# Internal code import
import physo
import physo.learn.monitoring as monitoring
```

It is recommended to fix the seed for reproducibility:
```
# Seed
seed = 0
np.random.seed(seed)
torch.manual_seed(seed)
```

### Making synthetic datasets

Making a toy synthetic dataset:
```
# Making toy synthetic data
z = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, 50)
v = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, 50)
X = np.stack((z, v), axis=0)
y = 1.234*9.807*z + 1.234*v**2
```
It should be noted that free constants search starts around 1. by default. Therefore when using default hyperparameters, normalizing the data around an order of magnitude of 1 is strongly recommended.

---

__DA side notes__:  
$\Phi$-SO can exploit DA (dimensional analysis) to make SR more efficient.  
On can consider the physical units of $X=(z,v)$, $z$ being a length of dimension $L^{1}, T^{0}, M^{0}$, v a velocity of dimension $L^{1}, T^{-1}, M^{0}$, $y=E$ if an energy of dimension $L^{2}, T^{-2}, M^{1}$.
If you are not working on a physics problem and all your variables/constants are dimensionless, do not specify any of the `xx_units` arguments (or specify them as `[0,0]` for all variables/constants) and `physo` will perform a dimensionless symbolic regression task.  

---

Datasets plot:
```
n_dim = X.shape[0]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(n_dim, 1, figsize=(10,5))
for i in range (n_dim):
    curr_ax = ax if n_dim==1 else ax[i]
    curr_ax.plot(X[i], y, 'k.',)
    curr_ax.set_xlabel("X[%i]"%(i))
    curr_ax.set_ylabel("y")
plt.show()
```

### SR configuration

It should be noted that SR capabilities of `physo` are heavily dependent on hyperparameters, it is therefore recommended to tune hyperparameters to your own specific problem for doing science.  
Summary of currently available hyperparameters presets configurations:

|  Config    |            Recommended usecases                           |    Speed    |   Effectiveness   |                           Notes                                |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `config0`  | Demos                                                     |     â˜…â˜…â˜…     |          â˜…        | Light and fast config.                                         |

| `config2`  | SR ; Class SR                                             |      â˜…â˜…     |         â˜…â˜…        | Config used for Class Benchmark.                               |

$^*$ DA = Dimensional Analysis

Users are encouraged to edit configurations (they can be found in: [physo/config/](https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO/tree/main/physo/config)).  
By default, `config0` is used, however it is recommended to follow the upper recommendations for doing science.

---
__DA side notes__:   
1. During the first tens of iterations, the neural network is typically still learning the rules of dimensional analysis, resulting in most candidates being discarded and not learned on, effectively resulting in a much smaller batch size (typically 10x smaller), thus making the evaluation process much less computationally expensive. It is therefore recommended to compensate this behavior by using a higher batch size configuration which helps provide the neural network sufficient learning information.

Logging and visualisation setup:
```
save_path_training_curves = 'demo_curves.png'
save_path_log             = 'demo.log'

run_logger     = lambda : monitoring.RunLogger(save_path = save_path_log,
                                                do_save = True)

run_visualiser = lambda : monitoring.RunVisualiser (epoch_refresh_rate = 1,
                                           save_path = save_path_training_curves,
                                           do_show   = False,
                                           do_prints = True,
                                           do_save   = True, )
```

### Running SR

Given variables data $(x_0,..., x_n)$ (here $(z, v)$ ), the root variable $y$ (here $E$) as well as free and fixed constants, you can run an SR task to recover $f$ via the following command.

---

__DA side notes__:    
Here we are allowing the use of a fixed constant $1$ of dimension $L^{0}, T^{0}, M^{0}$ (ie dimensionless) and free constants $m$ of dimension $L^{0}, T^{0}, M^{1}$ and $g$ of dimension $L^{1}, T^{-2}, M^{0}$.  
It should be noted that here the units vector are of size 3 (eg: `[1, 0, 0]`) as in this example the variables have units dependent on length, time and mass only.
However, units vectors can be of any size $\leq 7$ as long as it is consistent across X, y and constants, allowing the user to express any units (dependent on length, time, mass, temperature, electric current, amount of light, or amount of matter). 
In addition, dimensional analysis can be performed regardless of the order in which units are given, allowing the user to use any convention ([length, mass, time] or [mass, time, length] etc.) as long as it is consistent across X,y and constants.

```

### Inspecting the best expression found

__Getting best expression:__

The best expression found (in accuracy) is returned in the `expression` variable:
```
best_expr = expression
print(best_expr.get_infix_pretty())
```
```
>>> 
                     2           
    -gâ‹…mâ‹…z + -vâ‹…vâ‹…sin (1.0)â‹…1.0â‹…m
```

It can also be loaded later on from log files:
```
import physo
from physo.benchmark.utils import symbolic_utils as su
import sympy

# Loading pareto front expressions
pareto_expressions = physo.read_pareto_pkl("demo_curves_pareto.pkl")
# Most accurate expression is the last in the Pareto front:
best_expr = pareto_expressions[-1]
print(best_expr.get_infix_pretty())
```

__Display:__

The expression can be converted into...  
A sympy expression:

```
best_expr.get_infix_sympy()
```
```
>>> -g*m*z - v*v*sin(1.0)**2*1.0*m
```

A sympy expression (with evaluated free constants values):

```
best_expr.get_infix_sympy(evaluate_consts=True)[0]
```

```
>>> 1.74275713004454*v**2*sin(1.0)**2 + 12.1018380702846*z
```

A latex string:

```
best_expr.get_infix_latex()
```

```
>>> '\\frac{m \\left(- 1000000000000000 g z - 708073418273571 v^{2}\\right)}{1000000000000000}'
```

A latex string (with evaluated free constants values):
```
sympy.latex(best_expr.get_infix_sympy(evaluate_consts=True))
```

```
>>> '\\mathtt{\\text{[1.74275713004454*v**2*sin(1.0)**2 + 12.1018380702846*z]}}'
```

__Getting free constant values:__

```
best_expr.free_consts
```
```
>>> FreeConstantsTable
     -> Class consts (['g' 'm']) : (1, 2)
     -> Spe consts   ([]) : (1, 0, 1)
```

```
best_expr.free_consts.class_values
```
```
>>> tensor([[ 6.9441, -1.7428]], dtype=torch.float64)
```

### Checking exact symbolic recovery

```
# To sympy
best_expr = best_expr.get_infix_sympy(evaluate_consts=True)

best_expr = best_expr[0]

# Printing best expression simplified and with rounded constants
print("best_expr : ", su.clean_sympy_expr(best_expr, round_decimal = 4))

# Target expression was:
target_expr = sympy.parse_expr("1.234*9.807*z + 1.234*v**2")
print("target_expr : ", su.clean_sympy_expr(target_expr, round_decimal = 4))

# Check equivalence
print("\nChecking equivalence:")
is_equivalent, log = su.compare_expression(
                        trial_expr  = best_expr,
                        target_expr = target_expr,
                        handle_trigo            = True,
                        prevent_zero_frac       = True,
                        prevent_inf_equivalence = True,
                        verbose                 = True,
)
print("Is equivalent:", is_equivalent)
```

```
>>> best_expr :  1.234*v**2 + 12.1018*z
    target_expr :  1.234*v**2 + 12.1018*z
    
    Checking equivalence:

       -> Simplified expression : 1.23*v**2 + 12.1*z

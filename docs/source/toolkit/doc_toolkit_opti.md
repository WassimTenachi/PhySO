## I just want to use `physo`â€™s optimization scheme

A tutorial is available for anyone who simply wants to use `physo`â€™s free constant optimization scheme - without necessarily diving into symbolic optimization or machine learning. 

It contains a simple example of how to optimize constants in a function using PyTorch's auto-differentiation and LBFGS optimizer.

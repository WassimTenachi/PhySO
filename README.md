## What's New ✨  

**2025-07** : 🐍 Python 3.12 + latest `NumPy`/`PyTorch`/`SymPy` support.  
**2024-06** : 📚 Full documentation overhaul.  
**2024-05** : 🔬 **Class SR**: Multi-dataset symbolic regression.  
**2024-02** : 🎯 Uncertainty-aware fitting.

## Highlights

$\Phi$-SO's symbolic regression module uses deep reinforcement learning to infer analytical physical laws that fit data points, searching in the space of functional forms.  

`physo` is able to leverage:

* Physical units constraints, reducing the search space with dimensional analysis ([[Tenachi et al 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03192))

* Class constraints, searching for a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters ([[Tenachi et al 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01816))

Performances on the standard Feynman benchmark from [SRBench](https://github.com/cavalab/srbench/tree/master)) comprising 120 expressions from the Feynman Lectures on Physics against popular SR packages.

$\Phi$-SO achieves state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise (exceeding 0.1%) and shows robust performances even in the presence of substantial (10%) noise:

# Installation

The package has been tested on:
- Linux
- OSX (ARM & Intel)
- Windows

## Install procedure

If you are encountering issues with the installation, please refer to the [FAQ](https://physo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r_faq.html) or raise an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO/issues).

### Virtual environment

To install the package it is recommended to first create a conda virtual environment:
```
conda create -n PhySO python=3.12 --yes
```
Supporting Python 3.8 - 3.12; other versions may also work.

And activate it:
```
conda activate PhySO
```

---

**Without Conda (Alternative)** : 

If you are unable to use conda or prefer to use another environment manager, you can install the dependencies manually using `pip`:  
``` bash
pip install --no-index --upgrade pip
pip install torch >= 1.11.0
pip install numpy
pip install sympy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```
This approach is especially useful on some HPC systems, see the [HPC installation guide](https://physo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r_installation.html#hpc-compute-canada-users).

---


### Downloading

`physo` can be downloaded using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO
```

Or by direct downloading a zip of the repository: [here](https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO/zipball/master)

### Dependencies
From the repository root:

Installing dependencies :
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

In order to simplify the installation process, since its first version, `physo` has been updated to have minimal very standard dependencies.

---

**NOTE** : `physo` supports CUDA but it should be noted that since the bottleneck of the code is free constant optimization, using CUDA (even on a very high-end GPU) does not improve performances over a CPU and tends to actually hinder performances.

---

### Installing PhySO

Installing `physo` to the environment (from the repository root):
```
python -m pip install -e . --no-deps
```

### Testing install

Import test:
```
python3
>>> import physo
```
This should result in `physo` being successfully imported.

Unit tests:

Running all unit tests except parallel mode ones (from the repository root):
```
python -m unittest discover -p "*UnitTest.py"
```
This should result in all tests being successfully passed.

Running all unit tests (from the repository root):
```
python -m unittest discover -p "*Test.py"
```
This  should take 5-15 min depending on your system (as if you have a lot of CPU cores, it will take longer to make the efficiency curves).

## Uninstalling
Uninstalling the package:
```
pip uninstall physo
```
Removing the conda environment:
```
conda deactivate
conda env remove -n PhySO --yes
```
## Getting started (SR)

In this tutorial, we show how to use `physo` to perform Symbolic Regression (SR).
The reference notebook for this tutorial can be found here: [sr_quick_start.ipynb](https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO/blob/main/demos/sr_quick_start.ipynb).

### Setup

Importing the necessary libraries:
```
# External packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
```

Importing `physo`:
```
# Internal code import
import physo
import physo.learn.monitoring as monitoring
```

It is recommended to fix the seed for reproducibility:
```
# Seed
seed = 0
np.random.seed(seed)
torch.manual_seed(seed)
```

### Making synthetic datasets

Making a toy synthetic dataset:
```
# Making toy synthetic data
z = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, 50)
v = np.random.uniform(-10, 10, 50)
X = np.stack((z, v), axis=0)
y = 1.234*9.807*z + 1.234*v**2
```
It should be noted that free constants search starts around 1. by default. Therefore when using default hyperparameters, normalizing the data around an order of magnitude of 1 is strongly recommended.

---

__DA side notes__:  
$\Phi$-SO can exploit DA (dimensional analysis) to make SR more efficient.  
On can consider the physical units of $X=(z,v)$, $z$ being a length of dimension $L^{1}, T^{0}, M^{0}$, v a velocity of dimension $L^{1}, T^{-1}, M^{0}$, $y=E$ if an energy of dimension $L^{2}, T^{-2}, M^{1}$.
If you are not working on a physics problem and all your variables/constants are dimensionless, do not specify any of the `xx_units` arguments (or specify them as `[0,0]` for all variables/constants) and `physo` will perform a dimensionless symbolic regression task.  

---

Datasets plot:
```
n_dim = X.shape[0]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(n_dim, 1, figsize=(10,5))
for i in range (n_dim):
    curr_ax = ax if n_dim==1 else ax[i]
    curr_ax.plot(X[i], y, 'k.',)
    curr_ax.set_xlabel("X[%i]"%(i))
    curr_ax.set_ylabel("y")
plt.show()
```

### SR configuration

It should be noted that SR capabilities of `physo` are heavily dependent on hyperparameters, it is therefore recommended to tune hyperparameters to your own specific problem for doing science.  
Summary of currently available hyperparameters presets configurations:

|  Config    |            Recommended usecases                           |    Speed    |   Effectiveness   |                           Notes                                |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `config0`  | Demos                                                     |     ★★★     |          ★        | Light and fast config.                                         |
| `config1`  | SR with DA $^*$ ;  Class SR with DA $^*$                    |       ★     |        ★★★        | Config used for Feynman Benchmark and MW streams Benchmark.    |
| `config2`  | SR ; Class SR                                             |      ★★     |         ★★        | Config used for Class Benchmark.                               |

$^*$ DA = Dimensional Analysis

Users are encouraged to edit configurations (they can be found in: [physo/config/](https://github.com/WassimTenachi/PhySO/tree/main/physo/config)).  
By default, `config0` is used, however it is recommended to follow the upper recommendations for doing science.

---
__DA side notes__:   
1. During the first tens of iterations, the neural network is typically still learning the rules of dimensional analysis, resulting in most candidates being discarded and not learned on, effectively resulting in a much smaller batch size (typically 10x smaller), thus making the evaluation process much less computationally expensive. It is therefore recommended to compensate this behavior by using a higher batch size configuration which helps provide the neural network sufficient learning information.  
---

Logging and visualisation setup:
```
save_path_training_curves = 'demo_curves.png'
save_path_log             = 'demo.log'

run_logger     = lambda : monitoring.RunLogger(save_path = save_path_log,
                                                do_save = True)

run_visualiser = lambda : monitoring.RunVisualiser (epoch_refresh_rate = 1,
                                           save_path = save_path_training_curves,
                                           do_show   = False,
                                           do_prints = True,
                                           do_save   = True, )
```

### Running SR

Given variables data $(x_0,..., x_n)$ (here $(z, v)$ ), the root variable $y$ (here $E$) as well as free and fixed constants, you can run an SR task to recover $f$ via the following command.

---

__DA side notes__:    
Here we are allowing the use of a fixed constant $1$ of dimension $L^{0}, T^{0}, M^{0}$ (ie dimensionless) and free constants $m$ of dimension $L^{0}, T^{0}, M^{1}$ and $g$ of dimension $L^{1}, T^{-2}, M^{0}$.  
It should be noted that here the units vector are of size 3 (eg: `[1, 0, 0]`) as in this example the variables have units dependent on length, time and mass only.
However, units vectors can be of any size $\leq 7$ as long as it is consistent across X, y and constants, allowing the user to express any units (dependent on length, time, mass, temperature, electric current, amount of light, or amount of matter). 
In addition, dimensional analysis can be performed regardless of the order in which units are given, allowing the user to use any convention ([length, mass, time] or [mass, time, length] etc.) as long as it is consistent across X,y and constants.

)
```

### Inspecting the best expression found

__Getting best expression:__

The best expression found (in accuracy) is returned in the `expression` variable:
```
best_expr = expression
print(best_expr.get_infix_pretty())
```
```
>>> 
                     2           
    -g⋅m⋅z + -v⋅v⋅sin (1.0)⋅1.0⋅m
```

It can also be loaded later on from log files:
```
import physo
from physo.benchmark.utils import symbolic_utils as su
import sympy

# Loading pareto front expressions
pareto_expressions = physo.read_pareto_pkl("demo_curves_pareto.pkl")
# Most accurate expression is the last in the Pareto front:
best_expr = pareto_expressions[-1]
print(best_expr.get_infix_pretty())
```

__Display:__

The expression can be converted into...  
A sympy expression:

```
best_expr.get_infix_sympy()
```
```
>>> -g*m*z - v*v*sin(1.0)**2*1.0*m
```

A sympy expression (with evaluated free constants values):

```
best_expr.get_infix_sympy(evaluate_consts=True)[0]
```

```
>>> 1.74275713004454*v**2*sin(1.0)**2 + 12.1018380702846*z
```

A latex string:

```
best_expr.get_infix_latex()
```

```
>>> '\\frac{m \\left(- 1000000000000000 g z - 708073418273571 v^{2}\\right)}{1000000000000000}'
```

A latex string (with evaluated free constants values):
```
sympy.latex(best_expr.get_infix_sympy(evaluate_consts=True))
```

```
>>> '\\mathtt{\\text{[1.74275713004454*v**2*sin(1.0)**2 + 12.1018380702846*z]}}'
```

__Getting free constant values:__

```
best_expr.free_consts
```
```
>>> FreeConstantsTable
     -> Class consts (['g' 'm']) : (1, 2)
     -> Spe consts   ([]) : (1, 0, 1)
```

```
best_expr.free_consts.class_values
```
```
>>> tensor([[ 6.9441, -1.7428]], dtype=torch.float64)
```

### Checking exact symbolic recovery

```
# To sympy
best_expr = best_expr.get_infix_sympy(evaluate_consts=True)

best_expr = best_expr[0]

# Printing best expression simplified and with rounded constants
print("best_expr : ", su.clean_sympy_expr(best_expr, round_decimal = 4))

# Target expression was:
target_expr = sympy.parse_expr("1.234*9.807*z + 1.234*v**2")
print("target_expr : ", su.clean_sympy_expr(target_expr, round_decimal = 4))

# Check equivalence
print("\nChecking equivalence:")
is_equivalent, log = su.compare_expression(
                        trial_expr  = best_expr,
                        target_expr = target_expr,
                        handle_trigo            = True,
                        prevent_zero_frac       = True,
                        prevent_inf_equivalence = True,
                        verbose                 = True,
)
print("Is equivalent:", is_equivalent)
```

```
>>> best_expr :  1.234*v**2 + 12.1018*z
    target_expr :  1.234*v**2 + 12.1018*z
    
    Checking equivalence:
      -> Assessing if 1.234*v**2 + 12.101838*z (target) is equivalent to 1.74275713004454*v**2*sin(1.0)**2 + 12.1018380702846*z (trial)
       -> Simplified expression : 1.23*v**2 + 12.1*z
       -> Symbolic error        : 0
       -> Symbolic fraction     : 1
